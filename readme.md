# A Trivial Trivia Game  

## JS timers everywhere!  
The bulk of this project was centered around the use of interval timers and timeout functins. It turned out to be trickier logic sorting out all the functions and making sure that each function clears out previous timers as necessary. A single object was used to contain an array of questions, array of answer options, and an array of answers as 0 indexed values to the answer options.
